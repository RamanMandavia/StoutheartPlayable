# StoutheartPlayable
A recent playable build of Stoutheart, meant to showcase primarily my work/contributions to the project.

To exit the game, enter the Pause Menu, select Exit, and confirm the selection. On keyboard/mouse, the Pause Menu is opened with the "Enter" key, navigates with "W" and "S" keys, and selections are confirmed with the "F" key. With a controller, the Puase Menu is opened with the respective Start Button, navigated with the Left Analog Stick, and selections are confirmed with the South Face Button.
